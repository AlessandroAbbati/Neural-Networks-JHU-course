Code from neural network course, EN 605-647 at Johns Hopkins University 


This is a basic feed-forward back-propagation neural network. This code uses the method of steepest descent on a multi-layer network (input layer, to hidden layer with two nodes, to output layer with single node)
to map I/O pairs x1 = (x11, x12), x2 = (x21, x22), ..., to desired output values, d31, d32, ..., at node 3, respectively.
